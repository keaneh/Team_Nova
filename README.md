We're a blast

Team Nova consists of sophomore electrical engineer majors Keane Hamamura, Dylan Tokita and Tyler Yamauchi, mentored by Garrett Young. This team is a part of the newly created
Vertically Integrated Project Program for SCEL at the University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa.

Hawai'i relies heavily upon imported oil resulting in high energy costs and detrimental changes to our environment. Photovoltaic systems have become a more viable and positive
option for our community, however due to weather variability these systems create intermittency in energy.

SCEL is working towards creating smart Photovoltaic systems through the use of weatherboxes. We will be working towards constructing our own weatherbox to be monitoring climate
conditions around our campus to predict weather changes in order to optimize our energy usage.
